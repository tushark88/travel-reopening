Individual states and territories implement their own measures that may impact interstate travel.

From June 3, 2020, domestic travel within regions is possible. However, this may be subject to change by the Government concerning specific areas and to any relevant epidemiological risks.

All scheduled land, sea, rail, air, lake, and inland waterway transport services have been provided with regulations and guidelines to slow down the spread of COVID–19.
